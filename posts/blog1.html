                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    I wanted to work in the tech field because I genuinely liked using my computer. After finishing
                    school,
                    I chose Computer Science and Engineering and got admitted to a private college. The main subjects in
                    computer science—Operating Systems, DBMS, Networking, and DSA—are supposed to be the foundation for
                    anyone who wants to work in tech. But during my college years, classes were mostly online because of
                    COVID. I didn’t really learn much. I managed to get good marks by memorizing things for exams, and
                    then I forgot them soon after.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    If someone truly wants to enter the tech field, those core subjects are mandatory. But since I was
                    only memorizing answers to pass exams, I never properly understood them. On top of that, I struggle
                    with a mental disorder, which makes it hard for me to retain information. I can study something and
                    understand it a little, but after some time, I forget. Because of this, I lacked real skills, even
                    though I had a degree.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    After graduating in 2023, I enrolled in an online full-stack development course. They claimed they
                    would teach how code is written in the industry, but the classes were very basic. I ended up
                    teaching myself the MERN stack. Even now, I can build a basic CRUD application with authentication.
                    But despite that, I am still not considered hireable.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    During my BTech years, our teachers used to give us large sets of questions—sometimes 150 or 200 for
                    a
                    single subject—and tell us that the exam questions would come only from that list. So naturally,
                    like
                    any normal student, I memorized those answers. I wasn’t learning concepts; I was just memorizing to
                    pass. By the time the exams were over, I was left with almost no practical knowledge. I hate this
                    method of learning, because in the end you have a degree but no real skills.

                    My father now tells me to prepare for government exams, but that also depends heavily on rote
                    learning, which I don’t enjoy at all. Right now, I am unemployed, with no money in my pocket. This
                    is my story, and honestly, this is what happens in many private colleges.
