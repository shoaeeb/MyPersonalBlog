                    Lately I’ve been feeling something that isn’t exactly depression, but it isn’t nothing either.
                    It’s a quiet kind of sadness that sits in the background of my days. I don’t go out much.
                    I stay at home most of the time because I don’t really have a reason to step outside.
                    No college, no job, nowhere I’m expected to be. My world has become very small.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    What’s strange is that whenever I do go out, I actually feel better. Walking outside, breathing
                    different air, watching people pass by—it reminds me that life is still happening. But recently
                    something inside me has changed. When I walk and see couples or notice girls my age, I feel this
                    deep pull that I didn’t feel before. It’s not just attraction. It’s the realization that I’ve
                    grown to a point where I genuinely want a partner in my life.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    When I was younger, I didn’t think about love much. It wasn’t important. I could stay in my own
                    world and feel fine. But now the need feels real and intense. I want companionship. I want to be
                    close to someone, to share moments, to feel chosen and understood. It’s not about pleasure.
                    It’s about connection.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    What makes it harder is knowing that I don’t have the money or stability that I believe a
                    relationship requires. I don’t feel “ready” in the way society tells me I should be ready.
                    Because of that, I carry this quiet sadness. Sometimes I catch myself thinking that if I just had
                    enough money, enough security, then maybe I could allow myself to want love. Maybe I could
                    experience what others seem to have so naturally.
                </p>

                    "I don’t think I am broken. I think I am human."
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    I don’t think I am broken. I think I am human. I think this is what happens when you grow older,
                    when loneliness becomes more visible, when your heart starts asking for something more than
                    survival. I don’t want luxury. I don’t want perfection. I just want a little love in my life.
                    Maybe this sadness isn’t a sign that something is wrong with me. Maybe it’s simply a sign that
                    I am ready for something real.
