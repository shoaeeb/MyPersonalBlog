                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    Today I found myself thinking about a decision I made last year and wondering if it was a mistake.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    I had gone for an interview at a BPO company, and I actually got selected. It was a day-shift role,
                    which is not very common in India. Still, I chose not to join. The company had very poor reviews,
                    and something about it didn’t feel right to me. I don’t want to work in a place where I don’t feel
                    respected.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    I also know what I don’t want. I don’t like sales, and I don’t want a job that constantly pushes me
                    to convince or chase people. What I want is a desk-based role where I can use my basic technical
                    knowledge about computers in a calm and focused environment.
                </p>

                <blockquote
                    style="border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-color); padding-left: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: var(--text-secondary); margin: 2rem 0;">
                    "I don’t want to work in a place where I don’t feel respected."
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    I’m aware that, with my specific situation, finding such a job is not easy. But for now, I’m
                    choosing
                    to stay honest with myself about what I want and what I don’t. Let’s see where this path takes me.
