                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    In 2024, about one year after graduating with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering, I joined
                    a company in Kolkata called Webgrify. The position was introduced as a kind of “course” for
                    freshers—a
                    place where we would be trained and gradually prepared for technical roles. Like many fresh
                    graduates, I joined with hope, curiosity, and the desire to finally begin my professional journey.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    On my very first day, the CEO himself was conducting the training and assigning small tasks. When I
                    completed those tasks using ChatGPT as a tool, instead of receiving feedback or guidance, I was met
                    with repeated insults. I tried to speak respectfully and understand what was expected from me, but
                    instead I was labeled a “problem child.” By the second day, I was terminated, with the explanation
                    that I “did not fit” because I was “not a normal coder.”
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    At the time, I accepted it quietly and moved on. But in 2025, I decided to email and express that I
                    felt the way the situation was handled was unprofessional. The response I received was even more
                    personal in tone, containing remarks that were demeaning rather than constructive. What affected me
                    most was not losing the role itself, but the complete lack of basic professional respect—especially
                    considering the difference in age, experience, and position between a fresher and a company leader.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    I am sharing this not to attack, but to be honest about an experience that shaped how I now view
                    workplaces. As a fresher, you come in vulnerable. You are learning, unsure of yourself, and trying
                    to grow. In that phase, the behavior of seniors and leadership can either build your confidence or
                    quietly damage it.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    This was a hard lesson for me: technical skill is important, but the culture of a company matters
                    just as much. No matter how big someone’s title is, professionalism, humility, and respect should
                    never be optional.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you are a fresher reading this and looking for your first opportunity, please be careful about
                    where you begin. Choose environments that encourage learning rather than humiliation. Your
                    self-respect is worth protecting, and your first workplace should help you grow—not make you
                    question your worth.
