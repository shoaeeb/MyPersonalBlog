                    I’ve been trying to understand why something small can suddenly make my mood drop. I’m usually in a
                    decent headspace, but sometimes one interaction is enough to pull me back into that familiar
                    sadness.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    A week ago, I created an account on a website called Chatlib, where you can talk to strangers. I’m
                    not always active, but I message people occasionally. Recently, I started talking to someone who
                    asked for my Instagram ID. I shared it. After that, the conversation changed. Almost immediately,
                    she seemed uninterested in talking to me.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    I asked her why.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    No response.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    I asked again—still nothing.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    That silence bothered me more than the rejection itself.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    This might be one of the fastest rejections I’ve experienced, especially from someone who was a
                    complete stranger just minutes before. I’ve been rejected before—in interviews, in friendships, in
                    different parts of life. I can accept rejection. It’s part of growing up. What I struggle with is
                    not knowing why.
                </p>

                <blockquote
                    style="border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-color); padding-left: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: var(--text-secondary); margin: 2rem 0;">
                    "At least tell me the reason."
                </blockquote>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    When someone disappears without explanation, your mind starts filling in the gaps. You start
                    questioning yourself: Did I say something wrong? Was I not interesting enough? Was it my profile?
                    My words? Me? The lack of clarity hurts more than a simple, honest answer ever could.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    I’m not angry at that person. People have the right to stop talking. But I wish we were a little
                    more human with each other—especially online. A single sentence can bring closure. Silence only
                    leaves confusion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Maybe this is just how the internet works. Maybe not everyone owes us an explanation. But I believe
                    honesty, even when it’s uncomfortable, is kinder than disappearing. And sometimes, all we really
                    want is not acceptance—but understanding.
