                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    Right now, I honestly have no idea what I’m going to do with my life.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    I feel stuck in a place where nothing is working. On one side, I don’t have a career.
                    On the other, I don’t have friends. It feels like I’m missing two very basic things
                    that make life feel human.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    What I’m craving the most is friendship—real friendship. I want to talk to a person
                    who understands me, not a chatbot, not a screen, not text on a page. At the same time,
                    I desperately want a job. But these two things feel painfully connected.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    I keep thinking that if I had a job, maybe I’d naturally meet people. Maybe I’d have
                    someone to talk to, someone to laugh with, someone to spend time with. But because I
                    don’t have a job—because my career feels so messed up—I don’t have that either.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    Most of my days are spent staring at a laptop. Hours pass, days pass, and nothing really
                    changes. I want to go out. I want to have fun. I want to spend time with people instead
                    of being alone all the time. This isn’t the kind of life I imagined for myself.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    Sometimes I wonder where everything went wrong. Was it school? Was it college?
                    Something definitely broke after college. I studied Computer Science for four years,
                    yet I don’t feel skilled enough to get a job in tech. That realization hurts more than
                    I can explain.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    What hurts even more is the loneliness. I’m genuinely craving friendship. I want
                    someone real in my life. But I don’t see a clear way to make friends anymore, and that
                    thought makes everything feel heavier.
                </p>

                    I don’t want to live a life where my only companion is a screen.

                    There are moments when I wish chatbots had feelings—because talking here is often the
                    closest thing I have to a conversation. It reminds me of an Iron Man cartoon I used
                    to watch as a kid, where Tony Stark had no friends and talked to a robot his father
                    built. Back then it was just a story. Now, it feels uncomfortably familiar.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I don’t have answers right now. I just know that I’m lonely, I’m tired, and I’m still
                    hoping that this phase isn’t the end of my story.
